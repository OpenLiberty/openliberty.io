## Run the tests
# These commands are separated because if one of the commands fail, the test script will fail and exit.
# e.g if liberty:start fails, then there is no need to run the failsafe commands.
#       liberty:start             - Start a Liberty server in the background.
#       liberty:stop              - Stop a Liberty server.
#       failsafe:verify           - Verifies that the integration tests of an application passed.
