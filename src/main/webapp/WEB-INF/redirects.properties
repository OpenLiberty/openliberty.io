# A properties file for redirects. Should aim to be as specific as possible.
# The key is the url pattern to match on. In general it is best to do specific
# source to target redirects, so /index.html/ to /index.html rather than a
# wildcard. You can do a wildcard by adding a * at the end. If you add a * at
# the end all instances of the string prior to the * are replaced by the property
# value. Unlike servlet url patterns a * can be at the end of a string without
# a preceeding / However this should be done sparingly since it is more expensive.
