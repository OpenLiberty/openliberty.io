= Liberty ♥ Spring 
Michael Thompson <https://github.com/barecode>

Its been a few weeks since my https://springoneplatform.io/2018/sessions/websphere-on-pivotal-cloud-foundry[talk] at Spring One and I thought it might be a good time to recap and expand a bit on some of what https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bkREdrN1Vc[was said].

== Liberty loves Spring

We were at Spring One to talk about deploying WebSphere on Pivotal Cloud.
For a while the only path was to use the open source https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ibm-websphere-liberty-buildpack[Liberty buildpack].
The buildpack supports Java EE and Spring apps, packaged as EARs or WARs, deployed to Liberty. 
We've recently expanded support for Spring apps with Liberty.
Since 18.0.0.2, Spring Boot applications can be deployed directly to Liberty,
Liberty can be embedded in the Spring Boot JAR, and we've added support for building
Docker images which can be deployed to PKS or any other container service.

We think Liberty and Spring go well together.
We think it makes sense to make that easy.
As I said at Spring One: *Liberty loves Spring*
and we want to make it easy for Spring Boot developers to love Liberty.

=== Why Liberty for Spring Boot?

Spring Boot already comes with Tomcat as its default embedded servlet container,
so you might wonder, why use Liberty instead?

Well, Liberty is a tiny but powerful.
Designed from the ground up, Liberty is a small, fast, lightweight runtime for
cloud native Java applications and there's some really cool technology inside.
Liberty's auto-tuning threadpool and advanced security integrations for social
login and enterprise security solutions means Liberty is enterprise-grade open source. 

=== Why are we doing this?

We're updating Open Liberty to embrace Spring apps more than ever before.
But why are we doing this? It comes down to this: we honestly believe that Liberty
is the best runtime for Java applications and are always working hard to improve it.
Liberty was designed for virtualized environments, so its perfect for the Cloud and containers.
We also designed Liberty to be really easy to use, and we want as many people as possible to play with it.
That's why Open Liberty exists - to get people access to Liberty!

== > Stay Connected

We are constantly exploring better ways to make Liberty valuable to Spring developers,
and to contribute to the pverall Spring experience. If you have ideas, 
create a pull request or come talk to us on gitter.im: https://gitter.im/OpenLiberty/boost

I'm excited about what we can build together. See you at Spring One 2019 in home town of Austin, TX!
