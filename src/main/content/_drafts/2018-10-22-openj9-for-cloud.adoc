= Reduce your cloud costs with OpenJ9
Michael Thompson <https://github.com/barecode>

Resources cost money.
This is especially true in the cloud.
The more resource intensive the application,
the longer it takes to get to peak throughput,
the more it costs to run that app.

What if you could change a part of your application and see an immediate performance boost?
What if that same change could also save you significant memory usage?
What if that change was really, really easy?
Are you using the right JVM for your Java workloads?

The foundation of any Java workload is the Java runtime.
There are two main parts of the Java runtime: the Java APIs and the Java Virtual Machine.
The Java APIs define the programming model for Java and are versioned: Java 8, Java 9, Java 10 and now Java 11.
The Java Virtual Machine provides the interpreter and runtime environment.

https://openjdk.java.net/[OpenJDK] is the open source Java runtime.
OpenJDK is where the Java community collaborates on the Java APIs and
is the cornerstone of Java innovation.
The default Java Virtual Machine in OpenJDK is called HotSpot, provided by Oracle.
Since September 2017, thereâ€™s a new open source Java Virtual Machine in town:
Eclipse OpenJ9. Eclipse OpenJ9 delivers significant performance gains and memory
savings over the default HotSpot JVM in OpenJDK.

OpenJ9 is open source, is part of the Eclipse Foundation,
and is freely available for download from https://adoptopenjdk.net/[adoptopenjdk.net].
Builds for OpenJDK with Eclipse OpenJ9 deliver the same Java APIs you are used to
but with a new, high performance JVM. Built on the proven technology that has been
in the IBM JVM for over a decade, OpenJ9 is enterprise-grade open source.

With Eclipse OpenJ9, your applications start faster, run leaner, and have higher throughput
- allowing you to do more work with less.
OpenJ9 is ideal for cloud-based applications and microservices.

Changing the JVM used by OpenJDK is an inexpensive change that saves you money in the cloud.
Adopt OpenJ9 for your Java applications.
