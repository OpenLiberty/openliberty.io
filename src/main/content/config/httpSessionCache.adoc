|A reference to top level library element (string).

|

|+Identifies JCache provider files.+

|+uri+

|A file, directory or url.

|

|+Enable this option to reduce the number of cache updates required to remove invalidated HTTP sessions. Specify an hour of the day when there is the least activity. When this option is disabled, the invalidator process runs every few minutes to remove invalidated HTTP sessions.+

|* +ALL_SESSION_ATTRIBUTES+
* +GET_AND_SET_ATTRIBUTES+
* +ONLY_SET_ATTRIBUTES+


|+ONLY_SET_ATTRIBUTES+

|+Specifies which session data is written to the persistent store.+ +
*+ALL_SESSION_ATTRIBUTES+* +
+All attributes are written to the persistent store regardless of whether getAttribute or setAttribute are invoked.+ +
*+GET_AND_SET_ATTRIBUTES+* +
+Attributes for which getAttribute or setAttribute is invoked are written to the persistent store. This can be useful for applications that use getAttribute to obtain and mutate attribute values without using setAttribute to explicitly request that they be written to the persistent store.+ +
*+ONLY_SET_ATTRIBUTES+* +
+Only attributes for which setAttribute is invoked are written to the persistent store.+

|+writeFrequency+

|* +END_OF_SERVLET_SERVICE+
* +MANUAL_UPDATE+
* +TIME_BASED_WRITE+


|+END_OF_SERVLET_SERVICE+

|+Specifies when session data is written to the persistent store.+ +
*+END_OF_SERVLET_SERVICE+* +
+Session data is written to the persistent store after the servlet completes execution.+ +
*+MANUAL_UPDATE+* +
+Session data is written to the persistent store upon programmatic sync of the IBMSession object.+ +
*+TIME_BASED_WRITE+* +
+Session data is written to the persistent store according to the write interval.+

|+writeInterval+

|A period of time with second precision

|+2m+

|+Specifies how often to write session data to the persistent store. This value is used when a time-based write frequency is enabled. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+
