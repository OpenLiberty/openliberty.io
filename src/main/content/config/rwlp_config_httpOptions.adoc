|===
|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+AutoDecompression+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Specifies whether the HTTP Channel automatically decompresses incoming request body data.+

|+NoCacheCookiesControl+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Allows the user to control whether or not the presence of a Set-Cookie header should update the Cache-Control header with a matching no-cache value. This also adds the Expires header.+

|+http2ConnectionIdleTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+0+

|+Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that an HTTP/2 connection will be allowed to remain idle between socket IO operations. If not specified, or set to a value of 0, there is no connection timeout set. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+id+

|string

|

|+A unique configuration ID.+

|+keepAliveEnabled+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Enables persistent connections (HTTP keepalive). If true, connections are kept alive for reuse by multiple sequential requests and responses. If false, connections are closed after the response is sent.+

|+maxConcurrentStreams+

|int

|+200+

|+Specifies the maximum number of streams that an HTTP/2 connection can have active at any given point. Opening streams over the limit, will result on a REFUSED_STREAM (0x7). If not specified, the default value of concurrent streams will be set to 200.+

|+maxFrameSize+

|int +
Min: +16384+ +
 +
Max: +16777215+ +


|+57344+

|+Specifies the maximum allowed size of a frame payload the server will advertise in the SETTINGS_MAS_FRAME_SIZE HTTP/2 settings frame. This can be configured to any size within the range of 16,384 to 16,777,215 bytes, inclusive. If not specified, the default is set to 57,344 bytes.+

|+maxKeepAliveRequests+

|int +
Min: +-1+ +


|+100+

|+Maximum number of persistent requests that are allowed on a single HTTP connection if persistent connections are enabled. A value of -1 means unlimited.+

|+persistTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+30s+

|+Amount of time that a socket will be allowed to remain idle between requests. This setting only applies if persistent connections are enabled. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+readTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time to wait for a read request to complete on a socket after the first read occurs. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+removeServerHeader+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Removes server implementation information from HTTP headers and also disables the default Liberty profile welcome page.+

|+writeTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time to wait on a socket for each portion of the response data to be transmitted. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+
