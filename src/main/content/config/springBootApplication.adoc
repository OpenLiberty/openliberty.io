|+apiTypeVisibility+

|string

|+spec,ibm-api,api,stable+

|+The types of API packages that this class loader supports. This value is a comma-separated list of any combination of the following API packages: spec, ibm-api, api, stable, third-party.  If a prefix of +++ or - is added to API types, those API types are added or removed, respectively, from the default set of API types. Common usage for the prefix, +++third-party, results in "spec, ibm-api, api, stable, third-party". The prefix, -api, results in "spec, ibm-api, stable".+

|+classProviderRef+

|List of references to top level resourceAdapter elements (comma-separated string).
