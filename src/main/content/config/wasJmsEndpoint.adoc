|boolean

|+true+

|+Toggle the availability of WAS JMS Endpoint.+

|+host+

|string

|+localhost+

|+IP address, domain name server (DNS) host name with domain name suffix, or just the DNS host name, used by a client to request a resource. Use '*' for all available network interfaces.+

|+sslOptionsRef+

|A reference to top level sslOptions element (string).

|

|+SSL protocol options for the WAS JMS endpoint.+

|+tcpOptionsRef+

|A reference to top level tcpOptions element (string).

|+defaultTCPOptions+

|+TCP protocol options for the WAS JMS endpoint.+

|+wasJmsPort+

|int +
Min: +-1+ +
 +
Max: +65535+ +


|+7276+

|+The port used for WAS JMS client messaging application connection requests. Use -1 to disable this port.+

|+wasJmsSSLPort+

|int +
Min: +-1+ +
 +
Max: +65535+ +


|+7286+

|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+sessionTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+1d+

|+Amount of time to wait for a read or write request to complete on a socket. This value is overridden by protocol-specific timeouts. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+sslRef+

|A reference to top level ssl element (string).

|

|+The default SSL configuration repertoire. The default value is defaultSSLSettings.+

|+sslSessionTimeout+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+8640ms+

|+The timeout limit for an SSL session that is established by the SSL Channel. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+suppressHandshakeErrors+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Disable logging of SSL handshake errors. SSL handshake errors can occur during normal operation, however these messages can be useful when SSL is behaving unexpectedly.+

|+addressExcludeList+

|string

|+hostNameExcludeList+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of host names that are not allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. Host names are not case-sensitive and can start with an asterisk, which is used as a wildcard character. However, asterisks cannot be elsewhere in the host name. For example, *.abc.com is valid, but *.abc.* is not valid.+

|+hostNameIncludeList+

|+A comma-separated list of host names that are allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. Host names are not case-sensitive and can start with an asterisk, which is used as a wildcard character. However, asterisks cannot be elsewhere in the host name.

|+inactivityTimeout+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time to wait for a read or write request to complete on a socket. This value is overridden by protocol-specific timeouts. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms.
