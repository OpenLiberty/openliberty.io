|===
|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+host+

|string

|+localhost+

|+IP address, domain name server (DNS) host name with domain name suffix, or just the DNS host name+

|+id+

|string

|

|+A unique configuration ID.+

|+iiopPort+

|int

|

|+Port for the unsecured server socket opened by this IIOP endpoint+

|+tcpOptionsRef+

|A reference to top level tcpOptions element (string).

|+defaultTCPOptions+

|+TCP protocol options for the IIOP endpoint+
|===
[#+iiopsOptions+]*iiopsOptions*

+Specification of a secured server socket opened by this IIOP endpoint+


[cols="a,a,a,a",width="100%"]

|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+id+

|string

|

|+A unique configuration ID.+

|+iiopsPort+

|int

|

|+Specify the port to be configured with the SSL options.+

|+sessionTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+1d+

|+Amount of time to wait for a read or write request to complete on a socket. This value is overridden by protocol-specific timeouts. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+sslRef+

|A reference to top level ssl element (string).

|

|+The default SSL configuration repertoire. The default value is defaultSSLSettings.+

|+sslSessionTimeout+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+8640ms+

|+The timeout limit for an SSL session that is established by the SSL Channel. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+suppressHandshakeErrors+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Disable logging of SSL handshake errors. SSL handshake errors can occur during normal operation, however these messages can be useful when SSL is behaving unexpectedly.+

|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+addressExcludeList+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of addresses that are not allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. You can specify IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. All values in an IPv4 or IPv6 address must be represented by a number or by an asterisk wildcard character.+

|+addressIncludeList+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of addresses that are allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. You can specify IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. All values in an IPv4 or IPv6 address must be represented by a number or by an asterisk wildcard character.+

|+hostNameExcludeList+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of host names that are not allowed to make inbound connections on this endpoint. Host names are not case-sensitive and can start with an asterisk, which is used as a wildcard character. However, asterisks cannot be elsewhere in the host name. For example, *.abc.com is valid, but *.abc.* is not valid.+

|+hostNameIncludeList+

|string

|+inactivityTimeout+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time to wait for a read or write request to complete on a socket. This value is overridden by protocol-specific timeouts. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+
