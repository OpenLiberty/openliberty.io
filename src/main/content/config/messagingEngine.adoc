+A messaging engine is a component, running inside a server, that manages messaging resources. Applications are connected to a messaging engine when they send and receive messages.+

[#+alias+]*alias*

+An alias destination maps an alternative name for a bus destination. You can use an alias destination for point-to-point messaging or publish/subscribe messaging.+

|+AssuredPersistent+

|+The reliability assigned to a message produced to this destination when an explicit reliability has not been set by the producer.+

|+id+

|string

|

|+The name of the alias queue or alias topic space.+

|+sendAllowed+

|* +false+
* +true+


|+true+

|+Producers can send messages to this destination.+

|+targetDestination+

|string

[#+fileStore+]*fileStore*

[cols="a,a,a,a",width="100%"]

|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+fileStoreSize+

|long +
Min: +20+ +


|+400+

|+The combined size in megabytes for both permanent and temporary store. The file store size is equally divided between permanent  and temporary store. For example, if you specify 400 MB as file store size then 200 MB is used for permanent store and 200 MB is used for temporary store.+

|+logFileSize+

|long +
Min: +10+ +


|+10+

|+Size in megabytes of the log file. The log file size cannot exceed half the size of the file store size. For a file store size set to 400 MB, the log file size cannot exceed 200 MB. The maximum recommended log file size is 25% of the file store size. For a file store size set to 400 MB, the maximum recommended setting for log file size would be 100 MB.+

|string

|+${server.output.dir}/messaging/messageStore+

|+Path to the file store.+
