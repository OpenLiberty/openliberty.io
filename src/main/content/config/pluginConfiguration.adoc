+Properties used when generating the web server plugin configuration file+

[cols="a,a,a,a",width="100%"]
|===
|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+ESIEnable+

|boolean

|+true+

|+ESIEnable property enables Edge Side Include processing to cache the responses. This property provides the option to disable ESI in the web server plugin configuration file.+

|+ESIEnableToPassCookies+

|boolean

|+false+

|+ESIEnableToPassCookies allows forwarding of session cookies to WebSphere Application Server. This property provides the option to override the value in the web server plugin configuration file.+

|+ESIInvalidationMonitor+

|boolean

|+false+

|+ESIInvalidationMonitor specifies if the ESI processor should receive invalidations from the application server. This property provides the option to override the value in the web server plugin configuration file.+

|+ESIMaxCacheSize+

|int

|+1024+

|+ESIMaxCacheSize is the maximum size of the cache which defaults to 1MB. This property provides the option to override the value in the web server plugin configuration file.+

|+connectTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+5s+

|+Identifies the maximum amount of time that the application server should maintain a connection with the web server. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+extendedHandshake+

|boolean

|+false+

|+If true, the web server plugin uses an extended handshake to determine if the application server is running.+

|+httpEndpointRef+

|A reference to top level httpEndpoint element (string).

|+defaultHttpEndpoint+

|+Specify the identifier of the http endpoint to include in the generated plugin-cfg.xml file. The endpoint defines the server in the cluster. The default value is 'defaultHttpEndpoint'.+

|+ipv6Preferred+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Used when resolving an application server host name of {null} or {0}, to prefer the type of address when possible+

|+loadBalanceWeight+

|int

|+20+

|+This value is dynamically changed during run time. The weight of a server is lowered each time a request is assigned to that server. When all weights for all servers drop to 0 or a lesser value, the web server plug-in readjusts all the weights so that they are greater than 0.+

|+logDirLocation+

|Path to a directory

|+${pluginInstallRoot}/logs/${webserverName}+

|+Deprecated: Identifies the directory where the http_plugin.log file is located. See Log file name.+

|+logFileName+

|Path to a file

|

|+A fully qualified path to to the web server plug-in log file. Directory component must already exist.  For Apache-based web servers, a path that begins with a pipe character is interpreted as an external piped logger.  If specified, the path overrides logDirLocation.+

|+pluginInstallRoot+

|string

|+/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Plugins+

|+Web server plugin installation location in file system of web server host+

|+serverIOTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+900s+

|+Identifies the maximum amount of time that the web server plugin waits to send a request or receive a response from the application server. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+serverIOTimeoutRetry+

|int +
Min: +-1+ +
 +
Max: +65535+ +


|+-1+

|+Limits the number of request retries after a read or write timeout. The default value, {-1}, applies no additional limits, so retries are limited by the number of available servers in the cluster.  A {0} value indicates there should be no retries. This value is scoped to the server cluster and does not apply to connection failures or timeouts due to the HTTP plug-in Connection timeout, or to web socket timeouts.+

|+serverRole+

|* +BACKUP+
* +PRIMARY+


|+PRIMARY+

|+The server role identifies a server as primary or backup. When primary servers are available, the web server plug-in uses them for load balance and failover. However, if none of the primary servers are available, the web server plug-in uses only backup servers for load balance and failover.+

|+sslCertlabel+

|string

|

|+Specifies the label of the certificate within the keyring that the plug-in is to use when the web container requests a client certificate from the plug-in.+

|+sslKeyringLocation+

|string

|+${pluginInstallRoot}/config/${webserverName}/plugin-key.kdb+

|+The fully qualified path to the SSL keyring file on the web server host+

|+sslStashfileLocation+

|string

|+${pluginInstallRoot}/config/${webserverName}/plugin-key.sth+

|+The fully qualified path to the SSL stashfile on the web server host+

|

|+Enables trusted proxies to be used. When specified, this property overrides the value in the web server plug-in configuration file.+

|+trustedProxyGroup+

|string

|

|+A comma-separated list of trusted proxies. When specified, this property overrides the value in the web server plug-in configuration file.+

|+waitForContinue+

|boolean

|+false+

|+If false (the default value), the web server plugin sends the "Expect: 100-continue" header with HTTP requests that have a message body. When set to true, the web server plugin sends the "Expect: 100-continue" header with every HTTP request. Consider setting this value to true if you have a firewall between the web server and the application server, and are sensitive to requests retries with no request body.+

|+webserverName+

|string

|+webserver1+

|+Name of the web server where this configuration will be used. Used to generate the plugin log file location if that is not specified explicitly by Log file name or directory.+

|+80+

|+Web server HTTP port+

|

|+Identifies the maximum amount of time that the web server plugin waits to send a request or receive a websocket response from the application server. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+Identifies the maximum amount of time that the web server plugin waits to terminate an idle websocket connection. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+
