|+password+

|Reversably encoded password (string)

|

|+Password of the user to use when connecting to the EIS. The value can be stored in clear text or encoded form. It is recommended that you encode the password. To do so, use the securityUtility tool with the encode option.+

[#+properties.wasJms+]*properties.wasJms*

+A JMS activation specification is associated with one or more message-driven beans and provides the configuration necessary for them to receive messages.+

|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+acknowledgeMode+

|* +Auto-acknowledge+
* +Dups-ok-acknowledge+


|+Auto-acknowledge+

|+The acknowledge mode indicates how a message received by a message-driven bean should be acknowledged.+

|+busName+

|string

|+defaultBus+

|+The name of a bus when connecting to the service integration bus in WebSphere Application Server traditional.+

|+clientId+

|string

|

|+The JMS client identifier needed for durable(and for shared non-durable) topic subscriptions on all connections. This identifier is required if the application is doing durable(and for shared non-durable) publish/subscribe messaging.+

|+connectionFactoryLookup+

|string

|

|+This property can be used to specify the lookup name of an administratively-defined javax.jms.ConnectionFactory, javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory or javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory object that is used to connect to the JMS provider from which the endpoint (message-driven bean) can receive messages.+

|+destination+

|string

|

|+Reference to a JMS destination+

|+destinationLookup+

|string

|

|+This property can be used to specify the lookup name of the administratively-defined javax.jms.Queue or javax.jms.Topic objects that define the JMS queue or topic from which the endpoint (message-driven bean) can receive messages.+

|+destinationRef+

|A reference to top level adminObject element (string).

|

|+Reference to a JMS destination+

|+destinationType+

|* +javax.jms.Queue+
* +javax.jms.Topic+


|+javax.jms.Queue+

|+The type of the destination, which is javax.jms.Queue or javax.jms.Topic.+

|+maxBatchSize+

|int +
Min: +1+ +
 +
Max: +2147483647+ +


|

|+The maximum number of messages received from the messaging engine in a single batch.+

|+maxConcurrency+

|int +
Min: +1+ +
 +
Max: +2147483647+ +


|+5+

|+The maximum number of endpoints to which the messages are delivered concurrently. The increase in the number can improve the performance, but it also increases the number of threads that are in use at the specified time. If the message order must be retained for all the failed deliveries, set the maximum concurrent endpoints value to 1.+

|+messageSelector+

|string

|

|+The JMS message selector used to determine which messages the message-driven bean receives. The value is a string that is used to select a subset of the available messages.+

|+readAhead+

|* +AlwaysOff+
* +AlwaysOn+
* +Default+


|+Default+

|+Read ahead is an optimization that preemptively assigns messages to consumers. This processes the consumer requests faster.+

|+remoteServerAddress+

|string

|

|+The remote server address that has triplets separated by a comma, with the syntax hostName:portNumber:chainName, used to connect to a bootstrap server. For example, Merlin:7276:BootstrapBasicMessaging. If hostName is not specified, the default is localhost. If portNumber is not specified, the default is 7276. If chainName is not specified, the default is BootstrapBasicMessaging. Refer to the information center for more information.+

|+retryInterval+

|A period of time with second precision

|+30s+

|+The delay (in seconds) between attempts to connect to a messaging engine, both for the initial connection, and any subsequent attempts to establish a better connection. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+shareDurableSubscription+

|string

|

|+Controls whether or not durable subscription can be shared across connections.+

|+subscriptionDurability+

|* +Durable+

* +NonDurableShared+


|+NonDurable+

|+Type of MS topic subscription. The value can be any of following values: Durable DurableShared NonDurable NonDurableShared+

|+subscriptionName+

|string

|

|+The subscription name needed for durable(and for shared non-durable). Required field when using a durable(and for shared non-durable) topic subscription.This subscription name must be unique within a given client identifier.+

|+targetTransportChain+

|* +InboundBasicMessaging+
* +InboundSecureMessaging+


|+InboundBasicMessaging+

|+Transport chains specify the communication protocols that can be used to communicate with the service integration bus in WebSphere Application Server traditional.+
