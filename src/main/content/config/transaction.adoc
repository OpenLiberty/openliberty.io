[cols="a,a,a,a",width="100%"]
|===
|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+acceptHeuristicHazard+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Specifies whether all applications on this server accept the possibility of a heuristic hazard occurring in a two-phase transaction that contains a one-phase resource.+

|+clientInactivityTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+60s+

|+Maximum duration between transactional requests from a remote client. Any period of client inactivity that exceeds this timeout results in the transaction being rolled back in this application server. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+dataSourceRef+

|A reference to top level dataSource element (string).

|

|+This is an optional property. By default the transaction service stores its recovery logs in a file. As an alternative it is possible to store the logs in an RDBMS. This is achieved by setting this property which defines a non-transactional data source where the transaction logs will be stored.+

|+defaultMaxShutdownDelay+

|A period of time with second precision

|+2s+

|+Default maximum shutdown delay. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+enableLoggingForHeuristicReporting+

|+heuristicRetryInterval+

|A period of time with second precision

|+60s+

|+Amount of time that the application server waits before retrying a completion signal, such as commit or rollback, after a transient exception from a resource manager or remote partner. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+heuristicRetryWait+

|int

|+5+

|+The number of times that the application server retries a completion signal, such as commit or rollback. Retries occur after a transient exception from a resource manager or remote partner.+

|+lpsHeuristicCompletion+

|* +COMMIT+
* +MANUAL+
* +ROLLBACK+


|+ROLLBACK+

|+Specifies the direction that is used to complete a transaction that has a heuristic outcome; either the application server commits or rolls back the transaction, or depends on manual completion by the administrator.  Allowed values are: COMMIT, ROLLBACK and MANUAL+

|+propogatedOrBMTTranLifetimeTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+0+

|+Upper limit of the transaction timeout for transactions that run in this server. This value should be greater than or equal to the value specified for the total transaction timeout. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+timeoutGracePeriodEnabled+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Specifies whether there is a delay between a transaction timeout and the abnormal ending of the servant region that was running the transaction.+

|+totalTranLifetimeTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+120s+

|+Default maximum time allowed for transactions started on this server to complete. Any such transactions that do not complete before this timeout occurs are rolled back. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+transactionLogDBTableSuffix+

|string

|

|+When recovery logs are stored in an RDBMS table, this property allows the table name to be post-pended with a string to make it unique for this Server.+

|+transactionLogDirectory+

|string

|+A directory for this server where the transaction service stores log files for recovery.+

|+transactionLogSize+

|int

|+1024+

|+Specifies the size of transaction log files in Kilobytes.+

|+waitForRecovery+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Specifies whether the server should wait for transaction recovery to complete before accepting new transactional work.+

Enabling this option incurs additional overhead on each getConnection operation. If vendor JDBC interfaces are needed less frequently, it might be more efficient to leave this option disabled and use Connection.unwrap(interface) only where it is needed. If updated while the server is running, the update is applied with new connection requests; in-use connections are not impacted.+

|+queryTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+false+

|+Use the time remaining (if any) in a JTA transaction as the default query timeout for SQL statements.+

|+validationTimeout+

|+Specifies a timeout for validation of pooled connections. When specified, pooled connections are validated before being reused from the connection pool. The validation timeout is also used when the connection manager validates connections in response to a stale connection for PurgePolicy=ValidateAllConnections. A value of 0 means that connections are validated without applying any timeout. Validation timeout requires a JDBC driver that complies with the JDBC 4.0 specification or higher. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry.
