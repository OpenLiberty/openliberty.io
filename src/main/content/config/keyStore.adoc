|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+fileBased+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Specify true if the keystore is file based and false if the keystore is a SAF keyring or hardware keystore type.+

|+id+

|string

|+defaultKeyStore+

|+A unique configuration ID.+

|+location+

|A file, directory or url.

|+${server.output.dir}/resources/security/key.jks+

|+An absolute or relative path to the keystore file. If a relative path is provided, the server will attempt to locate the file in the ${server.output.dir}/resources/security directory. Use the keystore file for a file-based keystore, the keyring name for SAF keyrings, or the device configuration file for hardware cryptography devices. In the SSL minimal configuration, the location of the file is assumed to be ${server.output.dir}/resources/security/key.jks.+

|+password+

|Reversably encoded password (string)

|

|+The password used to load the keystore file. The value can be stored in clear text or encoded form. Use the securityUtility tool to encode the password.+

|+pollingRate+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+500ms+

|+Rate at which the server checks for updates to a keystore file. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+readOnly+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Specify true if the keystore is to be used by the server for reading and false if write operations will be performed by the server on the keystore.+

|+type+

|string

|+jks+

|+A keystore type supported by the target SDK.+

|+updateTrigger+

|* +disabled+
* +mbean+
* +polled+


|+mbean+

|+Keystore file update method or trigger.+ +
*+disabled+* +
+Disables all update monitoring. Changes to the keystore file will not be applied while the server is running.+ +
*+mbean+* +
+Server will only update the keystore when prompted by the FileNotificationMbean. The FileNotificationMbean is typically called by an external program such as an integrated development environment or a management application.+ +
*+polled+* +
+Server will scan for keystore file changes at the polling interval and update if the keystore file has detectable changes.+
