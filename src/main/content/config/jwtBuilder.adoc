|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+expiresInSeconds+

|A period of time with second precision

|+-1+

|+Indicates the token expiration time in seconds. Takes precedence over expiry. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+expiry+

|A period of time with hour precision

|+2h+

|+Indicates the token expiration time in hours. ExpiresInSeconds takes precedence if present. Specify a positive integer followed by the unit of time, which can be hours (h). For example, specify 12 hours as 12h.+

|+id+

|string

|+defaultJWT+

|+This ID is used to identify the JWT builder. If an ID value is not specified, the builder is not processed. The ID must be a URL-safe string. The ID is used as part of the issuer value if the issuer configuration attribute is not specified. The JwtBuilder API uses this ID to determine which builder configuration to use to construct JWTs.+

|+issuer+

|string

|

|+An Issuer is a case-sensitive URL using the HTTP or HTTPS scheme that contains scheme, host, and optionally port number and path components.+

|+jti+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Indicates whether to generate a unique id for the token.+

|+jwkEnabled+

|boolean

|+false+

|+Indicates whether to use JWK to sign the token.+

|+keyAlias+

|string

|

|+A key alias name that is used to locate the private key for signing the token with an asymmetric algorithm.+

|+keyStoreRef+

|A reference to top level keyStore element (string).

|

|+A keystore containing the private key necessary for signing the token with an asymmetric algorithm.+

|+scope+

|string

|

|+scope.desc=Specify a white space separated list of OAuth scopes.+

|+sharedKey+

|Reversably encoded password (string)

|

|+Specifies the string that will be used to generate the shared keys. The value can be stored in clear text or in the more secure encoded form. Use the securityUtility tool with the encode option to encode the shared key.+

|+signatureAlgorithm+

|* +HS256+
* +RS256+


|+RS256+

|+Specifies the signature algorithm that will be used to sign the JWT token.+ +
*+HS256+* +
+Use the HS256 signature algorithm to sign and verify tokens.+ +
*+RS256+* +
+Use the RS256 signature algorithm to sign and verify tokens.+
|===
[#+audiences+]*audiences*

+The trusted audience list to be included in the aud claim in the JSON web token.+
