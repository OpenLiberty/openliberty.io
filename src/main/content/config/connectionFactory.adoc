|+agedTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+-1+

|+Amount of time before a connection can be discarded by pool maintenance. A value of -1 disables this timeout. A value of 0 discards every connection, which disables connection pooling. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+connectionTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+30s+

|+Amount of time after which a connection request times out. A value of -1 disables this timeout. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+maxIdleTime+

|A period of time with second precision

|+30m+

|+Amount of time a connection can be unused or idle until it can be discarded during pool maintenance, if doing so does not reduce the pool below the minimum size. A value of -1 disables this timeout. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+maxPoolSize+

|int +
Min: +0+ +


|+50+

|+Maximum number of physical connections for a pool. A value of 0 means unlimited.+

|+minPoolSize+

|int +
Min: +0+ +


|

|+Minimum number of physical connections to maintain in the pool. The pool is not pre-populated. Aged timeout can override the minimum.+

|+purgePolicy+

|* +EntirePool+
* +FailingConnectionOnly+
* +ValidateAllConnections+


|+EntirePool+

|+Specifies which connections to destroy when a stale connection is detected in a pool.+ +
*+EntirePool+* +
+When a stale connection is detected, all connections in the pool are marked stale, and when no longer in use, are closed.+ +
*+FailingConnectionOnly+* +
+When a stale connection is detected, only the connection which was found to be bad is closed.+ +
*+ValidateAllConnections+* +
+When a stale connection is detected, connections are tested and those found to be bad are closed.+

|+reapTime+

|A period of time with second precision

|+3m+

|+Amount of time between runs of the pool maintenance thread. A value of -1 disables pool maintenance. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+
