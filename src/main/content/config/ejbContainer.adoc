|+cacheCleanupInterval+

|A period of time with second precision

|+3s+

|+The interval between passivating unused stateful session bean instances when the size is exceeded. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+cacheSize+

|int +
Min: +1+ +


|+2053+

|+The number of stateful session bean instances that should be cached in memory.+

|+poolCleanupInterval+

|A period of time with second precision

|+30s+

|+The interval between removing unused bean instances.  This setting only applies to stateless session and message-driven beans. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+startEJBsAtAppStart+

|boolean

|

|+Specifies when EJB types will be initialized. If this property is set to true, EJB types will be initialized at the time applications are first started. If this property is set to false, EJB types will be initialized at the time the EJB type is first used by an application. If this property is not set, the behavior is determined on a bean-by-bean basis from the start-at-app-start attribute in the ibm-ejb-jar-ext.xml file. This setting does not apply to either message-driven or startup singleton beans. Message-driven and startup singleton beans will always be initialized at the time applications are started.+

|+maxUnclaimedRemoteResults+

|int +
Min: +1+ +


|+1000+

|+The maximum number of unclaimed results that the server retains from all remote asynchronous method calls that return a Future object. If the maximum is exceeded, the server purges the result of the method call that completed the longest ago to prevent memory leakage.+

|+unclaimedRemoteResultTimeout+

|A period of time with second precision

|+24h+

|+The amount of time that the server retains the result for each remote asynchronous method call that returns a Future object. If an application does not claim the result within the specified period of time, the server purges the result of that method call to prevent memory leakage. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|Name|Type|Default|Description

|+lateTimerThreshold+

|A period of time with minute precision

|+5m+

|+Number of minutes after the scheduled expiration of a timer that the start of the timer will be considered late. When a timer does start late, a warning message will be logged indicating that the timer has started later than scheduled. The default threshold is 5 minutes and a value of 0 minutes turns off the warning message feature. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h) or minutes (m). For example, specify 30 minutes as 30m. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1h30m is equivalent to 90 minutes.+

|+nonPersistentMaxRetries+

|int +
Min: +-1+ +


|+-1+

|+When a non-persistent timer expires, the timeout callback method is called. This setting controls how many times the EJB container attempts to retry the timer. If the transaction for this callback method fails or is rolled back, the EJB container must retry the timer at least once. The default value is -1, which means the EJB container retries infinitely until the timer is successful. If the value is set to 0, the EJB container does not retry the timer, however, this results in behavior that is not compliant with the EJB specification.+

|+nonPersistentRetryInterval+

|A period of time with second precision

|+300s+

|+When a non-persistent timer expires, the timeout callback method is called. If the transaction for this callback method fails or is rolled back, the container must retry the timer. The first retry attempt occurs immediately, and subsequent retry attempts are delayed by the number of seconds specified. If the value is set to 0, then all retries occur immediately. If you do not specify a value, the default interval is 300 seconds. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s). For example, specify 30 seconds as 30s. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90 seconds.+

|+enableTaskExecution+

|boolean

|+true+

|+Determines whether or not this instance may run tasks.+

|+initialPollDelay+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+0+

|+Duration of time to wait before this instance might poll the persistent store for tasks to run. A value of -1 delays polling until it is started programmatically. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+pollInterval+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+-1+

|+Interval between polling for tasks to run. A value of -1 disables all polling after the initial poll. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|+pollSize+

|int +
Min: +1+ +


|

|+The maximum number of task entries to find when polling the persistent store for tasks to run. If unspecified, there is no limit.+

|+retryInterval+

|A period of time with millisecond precision

|+1m+

|+The amount of time that must pass between the second and subsequent consecutive retries of a failed task.  The first retry occurs immediately, regardless of the value of this attribute. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be hours (h), minutes (m), seconds (s), or milliseconds (ms). For example, specify 500 milliseconds as 500ms. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1s500ms is equivalent to 1.5 seconds.+

|short +
Min: +-1+ +
