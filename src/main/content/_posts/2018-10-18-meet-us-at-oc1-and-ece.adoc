= Meet us at Oracle Code One and EclipseCon Europe
Michael Thompson <https://github.com/barecode>

Next week, two important Java conferences are happening at the same time: https://www.oracle.com/code-one/index.html[Oracle Code One] (previously Java One) in San Francisco, California and http://eclipsecon.org/europe2018/[EclipseCon Europe] in Ludwigsburg, Germany.

The Open Liberty team is going to be out in full force - manning booths, giving talks, and most importantly, handing out cool swag like Open Liberty t-shirts!

== Oracle Code One

Oracle has rebranded Java One to Oracle Code One and expanded its scope to bring new energy to the enterprise developer.
The schedule is packed and the Open Liberty team, along with our cohorts from the OpenJ9 team, will be there speaking at sessions and hosting BoFs.

Come meet some of of the Open Liberty and OpenJ9 team:
Graham Charters (https://twitter.com/gcharters[@gcharters]),
Emily Jiang (https://twitter.com/emilyfhjiang[@emilyfhjiang]),
Ian Robinson (https://twitter.com/ian_\_robinson[@ian__robinson]),
Tim Ellison (https://twitter.com/tpellison[@tpellison]),
Dan Heidinga (https://twitter.com/DanHeidinga[@DanHeidinga]),
Steve Poole (https://twitter.com/spoole167[@spoole167]),
Pratik Patel (https://twitter.com/prpatel[@prpatel]) and
Billy Korando (https://twitter.com/BillyKorando[@BillyKorando])

The IBM booth will have demos and experts for Open Liberty, OpenJ9 and Serverless and the Space Sentry Challenge!
We'll also be hosting quick labs on Open Liberty, MicroProfile, Kotlin and Spring.

Below are many of the sessions either hosted, or co-hosted by, the Open Liberty team, and a few shout-outs from members of the OpenJ9 team too!
